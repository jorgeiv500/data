In addition, the course introduces derivative securities (options, futures) and discusses their application in a wide variety of settings (real options, contingent claims valuation of equity). The course also covers the theory and practice of capital structure decisions (Modigliani and Miller, taxes, bankruptcy costs, asymmetric information, agency) and dividend decisions. The course will include a thorough discussion of market efficiency and an introduction to the field of behavioral finance.

Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to think deeply about the nature of business, the responsibilities of management, and how business and ethics can be put together. Cases without easy answers that raise a range of problems facing managers in the contemporary business environment will be used. Discussions will focus on developing a framework for analyzing the issues in moral terms and then making a decision and developing a set of reasons for why the decision was justified. Students will be pushed to think carefully about how they make decisions and develop their capacity to defend their decisions to other stakeholders. This is important as a way not only to foster integrity and responsible decision making, but also to push students to take leadership roles in dealing with complex and difficult choices they will face in their careers.

The course begins by examining how to organize the marketing function and then moves to the topics of buyer-seller relationships, sales force management, complexities and problems inherent in forging longer term partnerships, and developing and managing complex distribution systems along with some exposure to product development and launch. Cases have been chosen from a variety of settings, ranging from high tech to 'metal bending' and from the emerging to the more mature businesses. As opportunities arise, the course will incorporate a 'live' case. Working with a company to address critical marketing problems, student teams will be assigned to work on these problems. These projects comprise the final project for the course and take the class work from the written-case analysis to the real-time case analysis.
